# MarketPilot: Your Data-Driven Trading Assistant

MarketPilot is a TypeScript-based application designed to streamline market analysis and provide actionable insights for traders of all levels. It aims to automate the tedious aspects of data gathering, processing, and visualization, empowering users to make more informed trading decisions, identify potentially profitable opportunities, and ultimately improve their trading performance. This project is built with scalability and extensibility in mind, allowing for future integration of new data sources, analytical techniques, and trading strategies.

MarketPilot leverages a robust data ingestion pipeline that can handle real-time market data feeds from various sources, including stock exchanges, cryptocurrency markets, and forex platforms. This data is then processed and transformed using sophisticated algorithms and statistical models to extract relevant indicators and patterns. The application's core functionality revolves around providing users with a clear and concise overview of market trends, potential risks, and actionable trading signals. By automating these processes, MarketPilot frees up traders to focus on strategy development, risk management, and execution.

Beyond basic data analysis, MarketPilot provides a highly customizable charting interface that allows users to visualize market data in a variety of formats, including candlestick charts, line charts, and heatmaps. Users can overlay technical indicators, drawing tools, and custom annotations to further enhance their analysis. The application also includes a powerful backtesting engine that allows users to simulate trading strategies against historical data, providing valuable insights into their performance characteristics. This enables users to refine their strategies and identify potential weaknesses before risking real capital.

MarketPilot is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend its functionality through plugins and integrations. The application provides a well-defined API that allows developers to create custom indicators, trading strategies, and data connectors. This open architecture ensures that MarketPilot can adapt to the ever-changing needs of the trading community. The project also focuses on high performance, utilizing asynchronous processing and efficient data structures to ensure that analyses are completed quickly and reliably, even under heavy data loads.

## Key Features

*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Connects to various market data providers via WebSockets and REST APIs to ingest real-time market data streams. Uses TypeScript interfaces to define data structures for different asset classes (e.g., stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex pairs), ensuring type safety and data consistency across the application.
*   **Technical Indicator Calculation:** Calculates a wide range of technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) using optimized algorithms. Leverages libraries like `talib-binding` (or similar) to provide efficient and accurate indicator calculations.
*   **Customizable Charting Interface:** Provides an interactive charting interface built with a library like `Chart.js` or `TradingView Lightweight Charts`. Allows users to customize chart types, timeframes, and indicator overlays. Implements TypeScript decorators to manage chart settings and ensure type safety for user preferences.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** Simulates trading strategies against historical data using a vectorized backtesting engine. Supports various order types (e.g., market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders) and risk management parameters. Provides detailed performance reports, including profit/loss ratios, drawdown analysis, and Sharpe ratio.
*   **Alerting System:** Configurable alerts based on technical indicators, price movements, or custom conditions. Sends notifications via email, SMS, or web push notifications. Utilizes a rule-based engine implemented with TypeScript interfaces and classes to define alert conditions and actions.
*   **Strategy Optimization:** Employs optimization algorithms (e.g., grid search, genetic algorithms) to find the optimal parameters for trading strategies. Uses libraries like `scikit-learn` (via Node.js bindings) to perform parameter optimization.
*   **Modular Plugin Architecture:** Allows developers to extend the application's functionality through custom plugins and integrations. Provides a well-defined API for creating custom indicators, trading strategies, and data connectors.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Primary programming language, providing type safety, improved code organization, and enhanced developer productivity. Used for all core application logic, data models, and UI components.
*   **Node.js:** Runtime environment for running the application. Provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it well-suited for handling real-time data streams and asynchronous operations.
*   **React (or similar):** Used for building the user interface. Provides a component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of reusable and maintainable UI elements. Uses TypeScript for all React components and hooks.
*   **WebSocket (e.g., `ws` or `socket.io`):** Used for establishing real-time communication channels with market data providers. Provides a bidirectional communication protocol, allowing for efficient data streaming.
*   **REST API (e.g., Express.js):** Used for providing a RESTful API for accessing application data and functionality. Allows for integration with external systems and services.
*   **Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL):** Used for storing historical market data, user preferences, and other application data. Supports efficient data retrieval and storage.
*   **Charting Library (e.g., Chart.js, TradingView Lightweight Charts):** Used for creating interactive and customizable charts for visualizing market data. Provides a wide range of chart types and technical indicators.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/MarketPilot.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd MarketPilot
3.  Install dependencies:
    npm install
4.  Build the project:
    npm run build
5.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see Configuration section below).

## Configuration

The application requires several environment variables to be configured. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the following variables:

*   `NODE_ENV`: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., `development`, `production`).
*   `PORT`: The port on which the application will listen for incoming requests.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the database to connect to.
*   `MARKET_DATA_API_KEY`: The API key for the market data provider.
*   `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: The email address used for sending notifications.
*   `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: The password for the email address.

Example `.env` file:

NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/marketpilot
MARKET_DATA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_password

## Usage

To start the application in development mode:

npm run dev

This will start the application using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are made to the code.

To start the application in production mode:

npm start

This will start the application using the compiled JavaScript files.

The application provides a REST API for accessing application data and functionality. The API documentation can be found at `/api-docs`.

Example API endpoints:

*   `GET /api/data/historical?symbol=AAPL&from=2023-01-01&to=2023-01-31`: Retrieves historical data for AAPL between January 1st and January 31st, 2023.
*   `POST /api/strategies/backtest`: Backtests a trading strategy against historical data. The request body should include the strategy parameters and the historical data range.
