# MarketPilot: Autonomous Testnet Coin Arbitrage

A sophisticated trading bot designed for automated cryptocurrency arbitrage on decentralized exchange testnets, maximizing profit through intelligent buy/sell execution.

MarketPilot is a high-performance, autonomous arbitrage bot specifically engineered for navigating the complexities of decentralized exchange (DEX) environments. Built on a robust Golang backend and utilizing TypeScript for enhanced front-end interactivity (primarily for future UI development and data visualization), MarketPilot focuses on identifying and exploiting price discrepancies between different DEXs on testnets. This automated system allows developers and researchers to explore arbitrage opportunities without risking real capital, providing a valuable platform for testing trading strategies, evaluating DEX performance, and gaining a deeper understanding of DeFi market dynamics. The bot is designed for modularity, allowing for easy integration of new DEX APIs and trading algorithms. It continuously monitors price feeds, calculates potential profit margins considering transaction costs, and executes trades automatically when favorable conditions are detected.

The primary objective of MarketPilot is to streamline the arbitrage process, reducing manual intervention and maximizing potential profitability within the constraints of testnet environments. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of Golang, the bot can react quickly to fleeting arbitrage windows, minimizing the risk of slippage and maximizing the chances of successful trades. Furthermore, MarketPilot is designed with comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities, allowing for thorough analysis of trading performance and identification of areas for optimization. The integration of TypeScript prepares the project for future enhancements, including a user-friendly interface for configuration, monitoring, and reporting. This will enable users to easily customize trading parameters, track performance metrics in real-time, and gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their arbitrage strategies.

MarketPilot provides a valuable educational resource for individuals interested in algorithmic trading and decentralized finance. It offers a practical, hands-on experience in developing and deploying automated trading strategies within a simulated environment. The open-source nature of the project encourages collaboration and community contributions, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricacies of DeFi markets and the potential for innovative trading solutions. The robust architecture and well-documented codebase make it easy for developers to extend the bot's functionality and adapt it to different testnet environments and trading scenarios. This allows for continuous experimentation and refinement, ultimately leading to the development of more sophisticated and profitable arbitrage strategies.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Arbitrage Execution:** Continuously monitors DEX price feeds and executes buy/sell orders automatically when profitable arbitrage opportunities are identified. The execution logic incorporates slippage tolerance and gas price estimation.
*   **Cross-DEX Support:** Designed to integrate with multiple decentralized exchanges simultaneously. Currently supports [insert testnet DEX names here, e.g., Uniswap V3 (Goerli), Sushiswap (Goerli)] and can be easily extended to support additional DEXs by implementing new API wrappers.
*   **Real-Time Price Monitoring:** Utilizes WebSocket or API polling mechanisms to receive real-time price updates from supported DEXs. Price data is processed and analyzed to identify arbitrage opportunities.
*   **Risk Management:** Implements configurable risk parameters, including maximum trade size, slippage tolerance, and gas price limits. These parameters help to minimize potential losses due to unfavorable market conditions or unexpected transaction costs.
*   **Profit Calculation:** Accurately calculates potential profit margins, taking into account transaction fees, slippage, and gas costs. Only executes trades when the expected profit exceeds a configurable threshold.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Logs all trading activities, including buy/sell orders, price data, and transaction details. This data can be used to analyze trading performance, identify areas for improvement, and debug potential issues. Uses structured logging for easy parsing and analysis.
*   **Configurable Parameters:** Allows users to customize various trading parameters, such as arbitrage threshold, trade size, and gas price limits, through environment variables or configuration files.

## Technology Stack

*   **Golang:** The primary programming language for the backend logic, providing speed, efficiency, and concurrency for handling real-time data and executing trades.
*   **TypeScript:** Used for front-end development (primarily for future UI and data visualization components). Enables type-safe development and improved code maintainability.
*   **[Name of specific DEX SDK or API library used for Golang]:** Used for interacting with decentralized exchange APIs, simplifying the process of retrieving price data and executing trades. Provides pre-built functions for common DEX operations.
*   **[Specific JSON library used for parsing]:** Used for handling JSON data from DEX APIs.
*   **[Specific Logging Library used]:** Used for robust logging of bot operations and debugging.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/MarketPilot.git
    cd MarketPilot

2.  **Install Go dependencies:**

    go mod download
    go mod tidy

3.  **Install TypeScript dependencies (if you plan to work on the front-end):**

    cd web  // Navigate to the web directory (if it exists)
    npm install

4.  **Build the Golang application:**

    go build -o marketpilot main.go

## Configuration

MarketPilot relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following variables:



*   **DEX1_API_KEY, DEX2_API_KEY:** API keys for accessing the respective decentralized exchanges.
*   **DEX1_PRIVATE_KEY, DEX2_PRIVATE_KEY:** Private keys for signing transactions on the respective decentralized exchanges. **Important:** Use testnet private keys only!
*   **ARBITRAGE_THRESHOLD:** The minimum profit margin (as a percentage) required to trigger a trade.
*   **GAS_PRICE_LIMIT:** The maximum gas price (in Gwei) that the bot is willing to pay for a transaction.
*   **TRADE_SIZE:** The amount of the base token to trade in each arbitrage opportunity.
*   **LOG_LEVEL:** The level of detail to include in the logs.

## Usage

1.  **Run the bot:**

    ./marketpilot

    The bot will start monitoring price feeds from the configured DEXs and execute arbitrage trades automatically when favorable conditions are detected. The output will be logged to the console and to a log file (if configured).

2.  **Monitoring:**

    Monitor the bot's output logs to track its performance and identify any potential issues. The logs will provide information about executed trades, profit margins, and error messages.

3.  **API Documentation:**

    Currently, MarketPilot does not expose a direct API. All interactions are managed through configuration and logging. Future versions will incorporate REST API endpoints for status monitoring and control.
